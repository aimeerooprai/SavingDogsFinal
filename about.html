        <h3>Snowball</h3>
        <p> Named after blending into the snow, Snowball was hiding in the house - frightened by all of the noise. His owners thought he ran away. Snowball was found and rescused by Much Love where we found his real family! Snowball now enjoys Pizza every tuesday with his owners and can eat a whole slice to himself!

        <h3>Bean</h3>
        <p>Bean is a stray blind dog and was around the area of when the forest fires in California began. Since he cannot see, he was unable to find his way out of the forest. Thankfully, the wonderful firefighters were able to help Bean to safety. His favourite thing to do is balance objects on his head!
